Hooks are new feature addition in react version 16.8 which allow you to use react features   without having to 
write a class .

Ex: state of component 

Hooks don't work inside a class 

Why Hooks ?
Reason 1:
Understand how this key word work in java script .
Remember to bind event handler in class component .
class dont minify very well and make hot reloading very unrelible .

Reason 2:
There is no perticular reason statefull component logic .
HOC and render props pattern do address this problem .
Make the code harder to follow .
There is need to share statefull logic in a better way .


Reason 3:
Create component for complex scenarious such a data fatching and subscribing to events
related code is not orgnize in one place .
Ex: Data fetching - in componentDidmount and componentDidUpdate.
Ex: Event listeners - In componentDidmount and componentWilmount.
Beacuse of statefull logic.

no need to use this keyword

Rulse of hooks :
"Only call hooks at the Top level of files"
